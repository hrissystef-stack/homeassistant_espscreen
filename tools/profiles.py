"""The board profiles as the tests and tools read them (app 0.2.84+).

A screen is three files: an entry (`home-like-2432s028.yaml` or `packages/cyd.yaml` for a CYD, `guition-4848s040.yaml`
or `packages/guition.yaml` for a Guition), `packages/core.yaml` that every board shares, and the board's own file under
`packages/boards/`. `text(name)` is the three of them one after the other, so a check that looks for a line finds it
wherever it lives; `resolved(name)` also fills in the `${NAME}` substitutions from the three files (the sizes, the fonts
and the hooks with the board's code), for a check that needs the numbers or the whole lambda. Neither is what ESPHome
builds: that is the merge ESPHome's packages component makes (docs/PROFILES.md); the firmware check in tools/check.sh
compiles the real thing.
